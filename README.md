In this project, the students work exclusively within the set tasks and limitations.

## Stack Technology

### 🌴 Front-End

- Project uses `Angular 13`.

- The lack of a UI/UX-designer compensates by using the `Angular Material UI` library with ready for use components.

- `SASS` preprocessor (.scss syntax) is used for addition component stylisation.

- `.eslint` with AirBnB config and `.prettier` are used for maintenance code-quality and unified code-writing.
